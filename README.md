Website : https://spacechat.in/
WebApp Url : https://app.spacechat.in/

To understand why I started this project, Lets understand what products does WhatsApp has:
WhatsApp Products:
1. WhatsApp App (Majority people use this app to communicate with each others)
2. WhatsApp Business App (This was launched for small business. Where businesses can interect with their customer)
3. WhatsApp Business API (Initially for Medium/Large Organisations)

Above listed products are of WhatsApp and the project SpaceChat is built on the 3 product that is WhatsApp Business API.
But there is more that need to be told.

There are 2 types of WhatsApp Business API:
1. WhatsApp Business API (On Premise) (Costly as we have to maintain the app server)
2. WhatsApp Business API (Cloud) (Cheap or zero cost as the WhatsApp manages the App server)

What Benefits WhatsApp Business API provides as compared to the WhatsApp applications on Playstore and App Store?
Using API we can do countless things and invent and automate things accourding to our need with the help of a developer.

Popular use cases:
1. WhatsApp Chatbot
2. Automations (Sending WhatsApp Message/Template automatically)
3. Multi Agent can use a single number
4. No Code chatbot builder
5. Sending Promotional/Transactional messages
6. WhatsApp commerce (Selling on WhatsApp)


So, The SpaceChat is built on WhatsApp Busienss API (Cloud)

Why have I started SpaceChat?

Point 1:
NO MIDDLEMAN/VENDOR TO BUY API
Getting an OnPremise API is expensive and you have to buy it from a vendor
Getting a Cloud API is free of cost and Meta provides the API.

Point 2:
USING CLOUD API EVEN MICRO BUSINESS CAN ACCESS THESE SERVICES. (WIDE AUDIENCE)
As getting API becomes easier many businesses can try out the service and explore what things are working for them.
